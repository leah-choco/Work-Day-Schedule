# Work-Day-Schedule

Deployed Application: https://leah-choco.github.io/Work-Day-Schedule/

For this project, I was asked to finish creating a scheduling application that would be color coded based on the time (Gray=past, Red=present, Green=future). It should also allow the client to save the events that they added into the application. 

## Goals of this Project:
I was given an index.html file that was incomplete, and a completed style.css file. I created the rows and columns in the html file and then created a script.js to dynamically add the colors based off of the time and save the data entered into localStorage. For the time, I used the "Moment.js" API. In this application I also used "jQuery" and "fontawesome" for the icon. 

## What I Learned: 

This was my first time using Moment.js. So this project reinforced it's function to display the current time. 

The hardest part for me to figure out was displaying the data input to localStorage and that data persisting when the page is reloaded. I tried so many things and finally asked for help from a Learning Assistant. Through that process though, I really learned about it so I shouldn't have issues with localStorage in the future.

To reinforce my knowledge of HTML and CSS I did alter the start code to fit my aesthetic a little more. Adding solid border all the way around the rows, changing the text in the "jumbotron", changing the font-size of the input, and adding padding in the hour block to have it in the middle of the column.
